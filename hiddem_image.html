        <h1>Bruno Mars</h1>
        <p>Bruno Mars is an awesome dude, he creates msuic and his first album came out in 2010, he has several albums(4), my favoreite being An Evening With Silk Sonic with Anderson .Paak, he has several grammy wins and his made a big hit in the music industry specifically pop</p>
        <p> when he was yonger he won a best Elvis impersonation which i thought was pretty cool, just a random fact. Some of his most popular songs are Die With a Smile and apt, which are not really that good, as well as Locked Out of Heaven and Thats What I Like which are actual bangers. For a very long time he was number one in Spotify but currently as of writing this The Weeknd is number one but still a very big achievement for him to have. The songs listed are some of my more favorite of his songs</p>
